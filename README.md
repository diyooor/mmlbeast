Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

### app/

This directory contains the core application logic. It includes the `Application` class, which manages the high-level operations of the application, such as sending HTTP requests and interacting with the network layer.

### net/

The `net` directory houses all networking-related components. This includes the HTTP client (`Client` class), server setup (`server` class), session management, SSL/TLS certificates, and any utilities related to network operations. The client is used for making HTTP requests, while the server handles incoming connections and requests.

### log/

The `log` directory is responsible for logging functionality. It contains the logger implementation, which is used across the application to record events, errors, and debug information. The logger is configurable and can output logs to both the console and files, depending on the setup.
